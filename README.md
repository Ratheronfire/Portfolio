This is a sample of some of the class-related and independent work I've done related to Computer Science, as well as a copy of my resume.

[Stinkoman 20X6 - Godot Remake](https://youtu.be/FBNrEzdljwQ)

My newest project, a fan-made remake of the 2005 Flash-based platformer game Stinkoman 20X6. This remake is being written in the Godot engine, and is playable on browsers, desktops, and Android devices.

[Hades Run Suggester](https://github.com/Ratheronfire/hades-suggester)

An Angular webapp to suggest loadouts for the 2020 game [Hades](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades). Uses form validation to verify user inputs.

This is Age of Clicking, a game I'm developing in Unity. It's loosely based around RTS games like Age of Empires with elements of tower defense and incremental games. In the image above, you can see the player's units automatically harvesting and collecting resources for the player.

You can check out the most recent in-development build [here](http://ratheronfire.github.io).

This is a much older version of Age of Clicking, written in Angular 6, using the Phaser graphics library. I initially started this project as a means of learning Angular and various aspects of web development, and since then I've branched out and rewritten the game in a more robust library. However, considering the amount of time I spent working on the Angular version I decided it would be useful to demonstrate my work on that project as well. You can browse the source code for this project [here](https://github.com/Ratheronfire/AgeOfClicking).

This is a recording of a Unity game about a week or so into development (as of when the recording was made).  It's a simple game about swinging around, with a semi-realistic simulation of elastic physics.  You can see a sample of the script controlling the player character in the Player.cs.
